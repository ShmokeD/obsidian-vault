# Impulse Signal

An Impulse signal is one of the standard test signals. It is also known as the Dirac delta function. An Impulse signal exists only at zero. The magnitude of an Impulse signal is infinity. It is denoted by $\delta(t)$, and mathematically $\delta(t)$ will be infinity at $t = 0$ and zero for $t \neq 0$. An impulse signal is an infinitesimally narrow pulse with unit area and infinite amplitude. It is used to analyze system response to Impulse-like inputs. It gives the overall system response. Continuous Impulse signal is defined by its magnitude, whereas Discrete Impulse signal is defined by its amplitude.

There are two types of Impulse signals: Continuous Impulse signal and Discrete Impulse signal.

## Continuous Ramp Signal

A Continuous Ramp signal can be defined as the following expression given below:

$$
\delta(t) = \begin{cases} 
\infty & \text{for } t = 0 \\
0 & \text{for } t \neq 0
\end{cases}
$$

### Area Definition of Impulse Function:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t) \, dt = 1
$$

Thus, the above expression implies that it is a continuous Unit Impulse signal with area '1'.

### How to Generate Continuous Impulse Signal

First, we take a Rectangular (Gate function) of area '1' unit. Then, decrease its width in such a way that its area remains '1' unit. When the width of the Rectangular function tends to zero, the height of the rectangular function will be of infinite magnitude. It can also be generated by the Triangular function with the same concept.

## Properties of Unit Impulse Signal

Some properties of the Unit Impulse signal are as follows:

1. **Area under Unit Impulse function is Unity:**

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t) \, dt = 1
$$

1. **Impulse function is an Even function** (As its graph is symmetric about the vertical axis):

$$
\delta(t) = \delta(-t)
$$

1. **Scaling Property of Impulse Signal:**

$$
\delta(at) = \frac{1}{|a|} \delta(t)
$$

1. **Product Property:**

If $X(t)$ is continuous at $t = 0$, then:

$$
x(t)\delta(t) = x(0) \delta(t)
$$

$$
x(t)\delta(t - t_0) = x(t_0) \delta(t - t_0)
$$

$$
x(t - t_1) \delta(t - t_0) = x(t_0 - t_1) \delta(t - t_0)
$$

1. **Sampling/Integration Property of Impulse Function:**

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t)\delta(t) \, dt = x(0) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t) \, dt = x(0)
$$

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t)\delta(t - t_0) \, dt = x(t_0)
$$

## Discrete-Time Impulse Signal

A Discrete Impulse signal can be defined as the following expression:

$$
\delta[n] = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{for } n = 0 \\
0 & \text{for } n \neq 0
\end{cases}
$$

Where $n$ is an integer.

Discrete Impulse signal is defined by its magnitude, whereas Continuous Impulse signal is defined by its area. The Discrete Unit Impulse signal is also known as Kronecker's delta or Unit Sample. $\delta[n]$ is not affected by scaling.

## Properties of Discrete-Time Unit Impulse Signal

1. **Symmetric Property:** The Impulse function is an Even function (As its graph is symmetric about the vertical axis):

$$
\delta[n] = \delta[-n]
$$

1. **Scaling Property:** Scaling does not affect $\delta[n]$:

$$
\delta[mn] = \delta[n]
$$

1. **Product Property:**

$$
x[n] \delta[n] = x[0] \delta[n]
$$

$$
x[n] \delta[n - n_0] = x[n_0] \delta[n - n_0]
$$

$$
x[n - n_1] \delta[n - n_0] = x[n_0 - n_1] \delta[n - n_0]
$$

1. **Summation Property:**

$$
\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] \delta[n] = x[0]
$$

$$
\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] \delta[n - n_0] = x[n_0]
$$

$$
\sum_{n=n_1}^{n_2} x[n] \delta[n - n_0] = x[n_0], \quad \text{provided } n_1 \leq n \leq n_2
$$
