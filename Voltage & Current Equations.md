- device with minimum energy losses
- for transmission of RF energy
- made up of 2 conductors separated by a dielectric
- also consists of series __resistance__ and __inductance__, and parallel __admittance__ and __capacitance__

$$V(z,t) - R *(\Delta z) \, i(z,t) - L *(\Delta z) \, \frac{\partial i(z,t)}{\partial t} - V(z+\Delta z, t) = 0$$
