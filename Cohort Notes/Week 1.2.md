JS foundations

js calls dictionaries objects. The key is not written as a string but normally. 

```
sdadasd = {
	name:"Omkesh",
	age:20
}
```
But during calling keys are passed as strings or as object variables.

```
console.log(sdadasd["age"]);
console.log(sdadasd.age); // This is the same


console.log(sdadasd["name"]);
```


you can create array of objects.. simple stuff.
Functions are functions.

Callback Functions -> functions passed as arguement to other functions, which may be called by the other function.


```setTimeout(callbackFn, timeInMillis) ```
-> Runs callback function after time out finished ^b88f5d
