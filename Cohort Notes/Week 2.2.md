ECMAScript: Scripting language specification on which Javascript is based. JS must have all specifications, but can have extra stuff.

Major JS compilers are:
	- V8 - Used by chromium - written in c
	- SpiderMonkey - Used by FireFox - written in c + rust

 Node.JS -> Chrome's V8 engine + some backend stuff to create a new runTime.
 Bun -> NodeJS but better.
